/* Nekomata
Physical Description
The Nekomatas are medium sized humanoids with cat ears, a tail that splits in two before reaching the body, and occasionally have whiskers. They are usually slender and lithe in build, and are also known to have a vast array of hair and eye color of almost any known combination.

History
Though similarly cat-like with the Tabaxi race, the Nekomata are vastly different to the Tabaxi and are a lot more human-like in appearance. Some historians even believe that the Nekomata, and Tabaxi have a common ancestral line that dates back to ancient times, but nothing as of now has been confirmed.
